*AlienZ*: [dub=8][speed=5]WOWWW[/speed] you're so <color=blue>BLUE</color>
*PlayerX*: You don't say...
*AlienZ*: [question=0]I've never met anyone so <color=blue>blue</color> before!! Can I touch your primary ectolayer? 
[choice]Uhhhh, I guess? 
[choice]I'm REALLY not comfortable with that

*AlienZ*: That was really interesting, thank you! Such a strange texture. What are you doing around these parts anyway?
*PlayerX*: I'm actually looking for people to join my team - there's a planet that needs our help. 
*AlienZ*: Oh how awful! Sounds like an interesting adventure, I'll join you!
*PlayerX*: I'll send you a signal soon. But in the future, it's a bit rude to comment on one's primary ectolayer.

*AlienZ*: Oh but it's just [speed=5]SO[/speed] blue! 
*PlayerX*: Yes, it is. <i>sigh</i>
*AlienZ*: [question=1]Oh are you tired?
[choice]Not exactly. There's a lot on my mind.
[choice]Yes, of this conversation.

*AlienZ*: Can I help?
*PlayerX*: Actually, I think you might be able to...

[title=playxalienz4-begin]
*AlienZ*: Well there's no need to be so rude!
*PlayerX*: Look - there's a serious mission I need to address. If I'm being honest, I really feel like this conversation is draining, and I could use some help.
*AlienZ*: I'm really sorry to hear that. I didn't mean to upset you... [question=2]Can I help you?
[choice]Yes, there's creatures that need us!
[choice]Yes, you could be more conscious of your behaviour
